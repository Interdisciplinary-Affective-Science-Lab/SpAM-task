Spatial Arrangement Method (SpAM) programming project

 

Participant workflow:

    Input participant ID number
    Read instructions, proceed on command (e.g., spacebar, click)
    Drag and drop stimuli (words or images) so arranged by similarity
        Able to multi-select or lasso several stimuli and move together
    Indicate when arrangement is finished (e.g., right click)
    Goodbye screen

Data to output:

    Pairwise (Euclidean) distances between all stimuli (stimA, stim B, distance) (.csv format would be ideal)
    Static image capture of final arrangement (e.g., bmp, jpeg)

Necessary configuration items:

    Number of stimuli
    List of stimuli or file paths for stimuli
    For text stimuli, font size and character length (if needed)
    For image stimuli, absolute dimensions (e.g., height and length in pixels)
    Screen locations to randomly assign stimuli to
        We can give absolute or relative X and  Y coordinates for each stimulus, or more ideally we would have a GUI configuration panel to drag-and-drop 'boxes' where stimuli should appear
    Instructions for participant
        We can load these as an image file created from a PowerPoint slide if that is easier than specifying text strings and formatting mark-up
    File path to output data

Long-term goals:

    Able to configure task via GUI panel
        In the meantime, specifying configuration settings via .csv file is just fine
    Able to deploy task online, via email or survey platform such as Qualtrics
        Requires storage or server for data and configuration storage, need to check on our hardware specs

Other notes:

    Doesn't matter which language this is written in as long as it is fully commented for later troubleshooting and modification
    Ideally it would be Osx and PC compatible (though PC only is okay)
